# SPACETYPING

## Preview
This is a game that I used C++ and SDL2 to make as a personal project. It's easy and used for typing-skill-fun.

These are gameplay images:

You have to type **blue-char** enemy because it's locked target.

Type the **red-char** bullets before they hit you.

You will win when you get score more than 10000 and defeat all enemies.
